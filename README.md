# brewfuncs
Helpful calculations used in brewing beer

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save brewfuncs
```

## Usage
You can calculate estimated alcohol by volume using original and final gravity.

The /src directory contains the ES6 source code. /dist contains the down-compiled ES5
variant when a build is run.

## Tests
I am using mocha and chai for testing.

```bash
npm test
```
